# Frequently Asked Questions

## What kind of applications does Threport support?

Threeport supports any containerized application.  It doesn't matter what
language your app is built with.  Threeport intentionally does not dictate any
build processes, frameworks or app architecture.  Your continuous integration
processes need not change.  If your app can be built into a container image,
it can run on Threeport.

## Does Threeport support runtime environments besides Kubernetes?

Threeport can be extended to support other runtime environments or container
orchestrators, but Kubernetes is the only one supported today.  Threeport makes
using Kubernetes much more approachable and provides access to the capabilities
of that system.

## Which cloud providers does Threeport support?

Today, Amazon Web Services is the only supported cloud provider.  See our
[roadmap](https://github.com/threeport/threeport/blob/main/ROADMAP.md) for plans
to support others.
