# Getting Started

1. [Install tptctl](install/install-tptctl.md): If you don't have the Threeport command
   line tool installed, start with this step.

1. [Install Threeport Locally](install/install-threeport-local.md): Install the
   Threeport control plane on your local workstation.  This is the fastest way
   to see how Threeport works.

    a. [Deploy a Sample Workload Locally](workloads/deploy-workload-local.md): Deploy a
    sample WordPress app to see how Threeport manages workload delivery.

1. [Install Threeport on AWS](install/install-threeport-aws.md): Install the Threeport
   control plane on AWS in an EKS cluster.  This gives a more realistic example
   of how Threeport is used in practice.  This guide requires an AWS
   account.

    a. [Deploy a Sample Workload to AWS](workloads/deploy-workload-aws.md): Deploy a
    sample WordPress app to AWS.  This guide includes several dependency management
    features that illustrate the usefulness of Threeport.
