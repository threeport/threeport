# Threeport SDK

Generate boilerplate code for threeport and its extensions.

Here you will find the main package and commands for the `threeport-sdk`
CLI.  Today, its primary use is being called by `go:generate` directives alonside
code such as in `cmd/rest-api/main.go` where code is generated for the threeport
API server.

Any source code files with the suffix `_gen.go` were generated by this tool.  Do
not edit them directly as they will be overwritten when code is re-generated.
Instead, update this tool to alter the code generated where needed.

It leverages the [jennifer library](https://github.com/dave/jennifer) for code
generation which has good docs with many examples in its README.

For more information see the [internal sdk package
docs](../../internal/sdk/README.md) docs.

In future, this tool will become the threeport-sdk that will be used by
threeport developers and those building extensions to threeport.
