# Threeport SDK

Generate boilerplate and scaffolding code for Threeport and its extensions.

The SDK does two things:

1. Generates API object scaffolding.  When the user runs `threeport-sdk create`
   on an empty repo, the scaffolding for the API objects is created based on the
   user's SDK config.
   The user then adds the field attributes to those objects.
1. Generates the source code boilerplate and scaffolding for all components of
   the project.  This includes source code for the extension's API server and
   Threeport controllers.
   The user then adds the reconciliation logic to the controller scaffolding.

This applies to core Threeport itself and independently developed extensions to
Threeport.

Any source code files with the suffix `_gen.go` are boilerplate that should not
be edited by the SDK user developing Threeport or an extension.  These files
include a header comment to this effect.

Scaffolding that is intended for modification by the developer do not have the
`_gen.go` suffix and are not re-generated by the SDK after they are initially
created.  These source code files also include a header comment that says so.

It leverages the [jennifer library](https://github.com/dave/jennifer) for code
generation which has good docs with many examples in its README.

docs](../../internal/sdk/README.md) docs.
