# Threeport Codegen

Generate boilerplate code for threeport projects.

Here you will find the main package and commands for the `threeport-codegen`
CLI.  This command line tool is not intended to be used directly (although it
can be).  Its primary use is being called by `go:generate` directives alonside
code such as in `cmd/rest-api/main.go` where code is generated for the threeport
API server.

Any source code files with the suffix `_gen.go` were generated by this tool.  Do
not edit them directly as they will be overwritten when code is re-generated.
Instead, update this tool to alter the code generated where needed.

It leverages the [jennifer library](https://github.com/dave/jennifer) for code
generation which has good docs with many examples in its README.

For more information see the [internal codegen package
docs](../../internal/codegen/README.md) docs.
