# internal/workload

This package is used by the workload controller.  All logic for its reconcilers
live here.  It includes sub-packages for determining workload status and a
utility for working with workload resources.

Some of the code in these packages is generated by `threeport-sdk`.  Any
file with the `_gen.go` suffix should not be edited directly - it will be
overwritten by subsequent code generation.
