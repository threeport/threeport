# internal/kubernetes-runtime

This package contains the generated and custom code for the kubernetes-runtime
controller.  It reconciles state for runtimes by managing the objects needed for
cloud providers to run Kubernetes clusters.

It includes mappings for the threeport abstractions for cloud provider regions
and machine types.  This allows threeport users to use a common set of
configurations for Kubernetes runtime clusters, no matter the underlying
provider.  Threeport uses this package to translate the threeport values into
each cloud provider's implementation (so far AWS EKS only).

Some of the code in these packages is generated by `threeport-sdk`.  Any
file with the `_gen.go` suffix should not be edited directly - it will be
overwritten by subsequent code generation.
