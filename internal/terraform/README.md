# internal/terraform

This package contains the generated and custom code for the terraform controller.  It
comprises the reconcilers for managing cloud provider resources using Terraform
configs.

Some of the code in these packages is generated by `threeport-sdk`.  Any
file with the `_gen.go` suffix should not be edited directly - it will be
overwritten by subsequent code generation.
