# internal/gateway

This package contains the generated and custom code for the gateway controller.
The reconcilers in this package manage objects to reconcile threeport objects
that manage gateways for network ingress as well as DNS records for workloads.

Some of the code in these packages is generated by `threeport-sdk`.  Any
file with the `_gen.go` suffix should not be edited directly - it will be
overwritten by subsequent code generation.
