# internal/aws

This package contains the generated and custom code for the aws controller.  It
comprises the reconcilers for all AWS resources managed for workloads.

Some of the code in these packages is generated by `threeport-sdk`.  Any
file with the `_gen.go` suffix should not be edited directly - it will be
overwritten by subsequent code generation.
