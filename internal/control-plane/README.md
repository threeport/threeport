# internal/control-plane

This package contains the generated and custom code for the control-plane controller.  It
comprises the reconcilers that manage Threeport control planes from Threeport
itself.

## Genesis Control Plane

A "genesis" control plane is a Threeport control plane that is provisioned with
`tptctl up`.

## Parent & Child Control Planes

When a Threeport control plane is used to spin up another, new Threeport control
plane, the provisioning control plane is called the "parent" control plane.  The
provisioned control plane is called a "child" control plane.

Some of the code in these packages is generated by `threeport-sdk`.  Any
file with the `_gen.go` suffix should not be edited directly - it will be
overwritten by subsequent code generation.
