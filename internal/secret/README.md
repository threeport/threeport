# internal/secret

This package contains the generated and custom code for the secret controller.  It
comprises the reconcilers for managing workload secrets stored in a secret
vault.

Some of the code in these packages is generated by `threeport-sdk`.  Any
file with the `_gen.go` suffix should not be edited directly - it will be
overwritten by subsequent code generation.
