# internal/observability

This package contains the generated and custom code for the observability controller.  It
comprises the reconcilers managing observability systems for metrics collection,
log aggregation and observability dashboards.

Some of the code in these packages is generated by `threeport-sdk`.  Any
file with the `_gen.go` suffix should not be edited directly - it will be
overwritten by subsequent code generation.
