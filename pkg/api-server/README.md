# inernal/api

Here you will find packages used by the threeport API.  Concerns include:
* validating client requests
* managing client responses
* a custom context used as middleware by the echo framework
* `database` contains DB initialization
* `handlers` contains all the handler functions that process client requests
* `routes` defines the REST paths for API endpoints
* `versions` generates the response to queries for available API versions

Much of the code in these packages is generated by `threeport-sdk`.  Any
file with the `_gen.go` suffix should not be edited directly - it will be
overwritten by subsequent code generation.
