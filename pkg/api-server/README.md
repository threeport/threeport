# pkg/api-server

This package contains two things:

1. The API server packages for different versions of API objects.  These are
   defined in `pkg/api-server/[object version]/`.
1. A versioned library: this is in `pkg/api-server/lib/[lib version]/`.

See the [Versions documentation](../../docs/versions.md) for more information
on the versioning of objects and library packages.

Much of the code in these packages is generated by `threeport-sdk`.  Any
file with the `_gen.go` suffix should not be edited directly - it will be
overwritten by subsequent code generation.

## Versioned API Object Functionality

The functionality in these packages are for the API server handlers, REST path
routes and version endpoints for different API object versions.  This code is
inherently tied to particular versions of particular objects.

## Versioned Library

The functionality in this library is indenpendent of API objects and
is separately versioned for backward compatibility with other projects that
import this functionality.
