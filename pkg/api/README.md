# pkg/api

This package contains two things:

1. The versioned API object definitions: these are defined in
   `pkg/api/[object version]/`.
1. A versioned library: this is in `pkg/api/lib/[lib version]/`.

See the [Versions documentation](../../docs/versions.md) for more information
on the versioning of objects and library packages.

Much of the code in these packages is generated by `threeport-sdk`.  Any
file with the `_gen.go` suffix should not be edited directly - it will be
overwritten by subsequent code generation.

## Versioned API Objects

These object definitions constitute the data model for core Threeport.  Each
object is versioned to support API backward compatibility.  When required fields are
added to an object or when fields are removed, a new version for that API object
must be created.

Each API object type gets a table in the Threeport database.  Each field
attribute becomes a column in the object's table.

The generated code for the objects includes all the needed methods to satisfy
the `ReconciledThreeportApiObject` interface.

## Versioned Library

The functionality in this library is indenpendent of API object definitions and
is separately versioned for backward compatibility with other projects that
import this functionality.
