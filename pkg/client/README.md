# pkg/client

This package contains two things:

1. Client libraries for versioned API objects.  These are in `pkg/client/[object
   version]/`
1. A versioned library: this is in `pkg/client/lib/[lib version]/`.

See the [Versions documentation](../../docs/versions.md) for more information
on the versioning of objects and library packages.

Much of the code in these packages is generated by `threeport-sdk`.  Any
file with the `_gen.go` suffix should not be edited directly - it will be
overwritten by subsequent code generation.
